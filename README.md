# Inventory-App

1) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  For this project, I have been tasked with creating an Inventory phone application. The requirements included creating a Login page. The page should have access to a database of stored usernames and passwords. Users should be able to enter a username and password to log in using existing credentials saved in the database or add new credentials to the database. The second requirement was a page that asked the user rather they would allow SMS notifications. If no is selected, nothing happens, but if yes is selected, an sms notification confirming the selection is sent to the phone. The last requirement is creating an SQLite database that can be read and displayed on the screen. The user should be able to add, update and remove any item in the database.

2) What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  This app would be used for business purposes. Knowing this helped with my approach to designing the app because this mean the design had to be simple and efficient. Time is money and the user needed the app to perform changes to the inventory at quick paces. From the main page, the user can delete items from the database with one button press. Adding items and changing their quantities only take two button presses, so I believe I was successful in making the design simple and efficient.

3) How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  When developing software, I always try to remember OOP(Object-oriented programming) so my application will run efficiently and is easy to read.

4) How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  Coding in Andriod Studio, a phone emulator was used when testing the code. This process was important because it reveal when there were errors in the code. It helped reveal what was working and what didn't. When it didn't the app usually crashed on the phone emulator.

5) Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  The design process I had to innovate to overcome a challenge was right after designing the User interface. When I begin coding I had to modify how to view the
SQLite Database. In my initial design of the UI I used a list view to view the SQLite but changed it to a recycler view to best accomplish the goal.

6) In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  In my opinion, the component which demonstrates my knowledge, skills, and experience is the main page. It was the most complex aspect of the app to code, having to code the database, recycler viewer, and buttons so they all worked together.
