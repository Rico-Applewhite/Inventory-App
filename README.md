# Inventory-App

-Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For this project I was tasked with createing a Inventory phone application. The requirments included createing a Login page. The page should have access to a database of stored username and passwords.Users should be able enter a user name and password to login useing an existing credentials saved in the data base or add new credentials to the data base. The second requirement was a page that asked the user rather they would allow SMS notifications. If no is selected, nothing happens, but if yes is selected, a sms notification confirming the selection is sent to the phone. The las requirement is createing a SQLite database that can be read and displayed on screen. The user should be able to add, update and remove any item in the database.

-What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
